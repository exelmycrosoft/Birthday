        "content": "Sitting in a room \nWhere only echoes are stored\nThinking that without echoes\nAll the voices on this earth\nMight have been dead at birth. \n\nYou can  wipe out all the voices with ease \nBut what will you do with echoes ? \nI know now why the bamboos are in the valleys.\n\nHills without a voice\nGathering the echoes\nFor a time drowned in silence.\n\nLate comer did not hear the flute playing\nShe only collected its echoes and left. \nThe butterfly has gone, \nThe flutter  still remains on the petals \nListen to the stars carefully\nTheir echoes have golden hues. \nEven when all the sounds  are wiped out \nThe earth might live some more time \nBy spending the echoes frugally.\nA truck have  been spotted in the city\nCarrying echoes \nFor making them impotent.\nIt is impossible to predict \nWhat will  happen  to the voices  \nMortally wounded with bullets.\nAll the dungeons of this world \nwon't be sufficient \nTo imprison all their echoes\n00\nPoem By veerankutty\nTranslated from Malayalam by Dr.P M Ali",
